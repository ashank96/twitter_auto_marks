# twitter_auto_marks
This is an android application which saves the content urls of twitter feed of any user as bookmarks in the database,so that the user can view the saved url content whenever he/she wants.
This app is in it's very first phase and will be taken for further implementation and updation both with respect to UI and UX. The present version is a quite basic.

# Technology Stack
 1. Firebase       -for twitter login authentication
 2. PHP            -to make api calls from the server
 3. MSQL-MariaDb   -Database 
 4. Android Studio -recieves JSON from the php server and displays the content

# Steps to execute the code:
  Executing the code is pretty simple,as the server that makes the api calls is globally hosted -:for which the files in the public.html     folder are kept in the publichtml folder of the globally hosted website decoderssit.club.

 1. Download and install the twitter_auto_marks.apk file on your smart phone with internet connection.
 2. Open the app and login with your twitter credentials.
 3. You will be redirected to a dashboard activity wherein you can view all your bookmarked urls.


That's it ! It is so simple, Now you do not need to worry about missing out any important feeds.
